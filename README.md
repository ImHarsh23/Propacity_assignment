# Getting Started


### `npm install`

Run  this command to install all dependencies required for the project and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action.

### `Assumptions`

- There is no particular library mention for css that is why i use pure css with power of modules to avoid name conflict.
- I Havn't find any api for list of cities so i use  dummy data for cities. which you can show in utils/constants.js.
- This is a single layout application so there isn't any area where i can use lazy loading for component that is why i have not used it.

### `How to use`

- Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the application in action. By default detail page of delhi will be shown. But you can search specific 
city by typing in search bar and press enter.
